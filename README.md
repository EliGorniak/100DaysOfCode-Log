## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Code Log

### :bar_chart: Day 001 - October 21, 2020 - Wednesday 

**Project:** EDA of ENEM 2019 dataset, the most important educational exam in Brazil.

**Today's Progress:** Today I started following the first video of Data Immersion Week, by https://www.alura.com.br/imersao-dados, entirely in Brazilian Portuguese. During this week (10/19 to 10/23) the videos will be available daily with all the project.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good oportunity to start working with Google Colab, Python and some libs, like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Numpy.
