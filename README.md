## Code Log
### Day 01 - August, 03 2020 - Monday

**Project:** Proffy - A platform made with React, React Native and Typescript for teachers and students.

**Today's Progress:** Today I started following the first video of Next Level Week 02 Course promoted by https://github.com/Rocketseat (https://nextlevelweek.com/episodios/omnistack/1/edicao/2), entirely in Brazilian Portuguese. During this week (08/03 to 08/07) the videos will be available daily with all the project.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good oportunity to remember some basic concepts about React and CSS. It's the first time that I'm using Typescript on projects.
